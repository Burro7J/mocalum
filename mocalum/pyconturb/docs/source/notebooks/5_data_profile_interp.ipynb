    "As noted in the example on constraining with time series, if you want to your simulated turbulence to look like your measured time series when the simulation point is near a measured point, you need to have profile functions that will recreate the values from the data when needed. PyConTurb has a custom interpolator and profiles to handle this. The interpolator is demonstrated in another example; this one will focues on the profile functions that interpolate from the constraining data in `con_tc`.\n",
