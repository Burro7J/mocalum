This online web report provides results of Monte-Carlo simulations of single- and dual- Doppler uncertainties of reconstructed wind speed. It contains the description of a `python` package, called [mocalum](https://github.com/niva83/mocalum), which was used to perform the Monte-Carlo simulations. The description of [mocalum](https://github.com/niva83/mocalum) and results is to large extent sourced from the publicly available repository of [mocalum tutorials](https://github.com/niva83/mocalum/tree/master/examples) that are built using [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
